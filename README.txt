# Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning

The goal of this project is to gain a better understainding of the different of the different clustering algorithms, dimension reduction techniques and the limitations of each. :

 Mushroom classification - Custom dataset, original was from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification I added noise to the dataset so you must download mushrooms.csv file from this repository. 


Dataset: Survey Response (city/Rural) Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey
            You only need the responses.csv file from this kaggle site or you may download from the repostiory # Supervised Learning.
            
            
## Running the code:
You must have python 3.6 and the following packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, random, imblearn, mlrose 

To run the python script, NN.py you must first edit the location of the file to where you are storing them on your local machine. 
Once this is done, it's a simple as just running the code in a python ide of your choosing.

The rest of the python files need no editing, can simply be ran on the python ide of your choosing.
